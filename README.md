# Advanced Optmized

              
> The Newest Version of AO (1.5+mc1.21.4-beta-2) contains a mod only for NVIDIA Graphics Cards.    
> We are currently working on geting/creating a mod which is compatible with AMD, Intel and NVIDIA           
> AMD or Intel Graphics Card will still work with the newest Version of Advanced Optimized.          

**Advanced Optimized works with AMD Vega, RDNA / Navi 1-3 | nVidia GeForce, GT, GTX, RTX | Intel Graphics Card**

**Performance**

The performence of Advanced Optimized is even faster than Fabulously Optimized + Simple Optimized. Advaneced Optimized uses modern performance mods like Sodium, Iris Shader, Lithium, Better FPS and so on. The fast performance of Advanced Optimized helps Low End PC to get higher FPS than **Normal Minecraft, Fabulously Optimized, Simple Optmized.**

**Made & Build with Fabric**

Fabric Mod Loader is a lightweight, fast, Mod Loader and supports many mods on Modrinth 

**Open Source**

Advanced Optimized is an Open-Source Modpack, which means you can do anything with the modpack. I recommend not changing/removing any Mods from the modpack. If you do remove/change any mods, support for your modpack (In case it crashes) will be limited.
